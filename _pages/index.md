# Welcome to the neurotheory garden!ðŸ§ 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
This is a [[digital garden]] where I form new ideas and synapses by creating a network of interconnected notes. Notes cover a broad range of topics in theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and philosophy of science.

This site is a continual work in progress, so each note has a symbol to represent the stage of development.

ðŸŸ¥ : Note is not complete

ðŸŸ¨ : Note is complete, but all notes referenced are not complete

ðŸŸ© : Note is complete and all notes referenced are complete


To get started exploring the site, take a look at topics listed in the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[table of contents]]</span> or what has recently been checked off my <span style="font-weight: bold">[[learning to do list]]</span>.
