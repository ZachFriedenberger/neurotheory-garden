# Welcome to neurotheory.xyz! ðŸ§ 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
This is a [[digital garden]] where I form new ideas and synapses by creating a network of interconnected notes. Notes cover a range of topics in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning.
</p>

This site is constantly updated as I write, so notes under construction are denoted with ðŸš§. 

To start exploring the site take a look at topics listed in the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[table of contents]]</span> or what has recently been checked off my <span style="font-weight: bold">[[learning to do list]]</span>.
