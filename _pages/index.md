# Welcome to the neurotheory garden!ðŸ§ 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  To get started on your exploration of the site, take a look at topics listed on the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[table of contents]]</span>, recent additions on the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[change log]]</span>, or what has been checked off the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[learning to do list]]</span>.
</p>

This is a [[digital garden]] where I form new ideas and synapses by creating a web of interconnected notes, blog posts, and paper summaries. Themes cover a broad range of topics in neuroscience, mathematics, physics, machine learning, and philosophy of science. 


The purpose of creating this site is to share my notes, organize my thoughts, and improve my writing. Therefore, this site is a continual work in progress and notes may contain conceptual errors or typos. Feel free to reach out if you have any comments or suggestions!
