# Welcome to the neurotheory garden!ðŸ§ 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
This is a [[digital garden]] where I form new ideas and synapses by creating a network of interconnected notes. Notes cover a broad range of topics in theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and philosophy of science.
</p>

This site is a continual work in progress, so to be transparent each note has a ðŸŸ¥, ðŸŸ¨, or ðŸŸ© symbol to represent the stage of development.


To get started on your exploration of the site, take a look at topics listed on the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[table of contents]]</span>, recent additions on the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[change log]]</span>, or what has been checked off the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[learning to do list]]</span>.
