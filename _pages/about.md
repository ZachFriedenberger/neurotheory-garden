Hi! My name is Zach. I'm currently a PhD candidate doing research in computational neuroscience. 

At the moment my research interests are in dendrites, theories of cortical computation (i.e., predicitive coding), and creating tools for analyzing neural population activity. 

If you have any questions, comments, or find glaring mistakes in these notes I can be reached at zfrie007@uottawa.ca.
