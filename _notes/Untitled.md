## Experimental Setup
- 2-photon imaging 
- Track dendrites and somas over days
- Detailed reconstruction after experiments

## Results
- Soma + dendrities activity is correlated 
- soma-dendrite correlation decreases with distance
- 20% dendrite only events


- increased dendritic -specific activiyt during auditory stimulation 
- SST cells control dendritic activity 
	- more dendrite only events when SST silenced 
	- decreases the soma-dendrite correlation 
	- doesn't effect the firing at the soma 
- Does this mean the neurons are more compatmentalized?


- Q: Are SOM neurons selectively cancelling out the BAPs?
- Som neurons help guide the BAP by blocking backwards paths?
