- Covert attention task (attention directed independently than eye movement)
- Fix fovea (center of retina) on central dot and respond quickly to the apperance of peripheral target
- Target is cued with a central arrow or a box around the targets future location
- Valid cue reponse times were faster than invalid cues
- Pheriperal stimuli = exogenous (external event triggering attention)
- Central stimuli = endogenous (do not in themselves indicate target location, attention must be directed to the correct location according to information from the cue)

- From competative bias theory
	- exogneous cues = bottom-up bias based on prior expectation
	- endogenous cues = top-down bias
