- Communication through coherence (Fries 2005)
- [[Biased competition]]
- Feature integration theory

# Types of attention

1. Top-down
2. Bottom-up
3. Spatial

# Neurobiological implmentation

- Post synaptic gain
	- fast synchronous activity (e.g., increased gamma oscillations)
	- neuromodolatory (e.g., cholinergic)
		- acetacholine can increase gamma and can affect 
		- decreases inhibitory interneuron activity
		- gain directly (spike frequency adaptation), but the time course of release is not fast enough for quick 10-100 ms changes in attention
