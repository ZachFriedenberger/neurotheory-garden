- Biased competition (Desimone and Duncan, 1995) is a model of attention based on electrophysiological studies and earlier behavioral models.
- Goal of linking limited capacity (Lavie 1995 - perceptual load is important for attentional selection of stimuli) to recptive field electrophysiology

- Small low-level receptice fields compete to drive larger receptive fields at higher leves of the heiarchy

*Biased competition says that attention is an emergent property of competetion between stimuli for attentional resources*

i.e, in a objects must compete for neural represenation at some point along the visual processing stream

- This leads to the predicition that if two stimuli are presented within a cellâ€™s receptive field, the response to both will be smaller than the sum of the response to the stimuli presented separately
- This has been shown to occur (single cell recordings) in V2, V4, IT, MT, but not V1 where RFs are small

- Probability of which stimuli are represented by cells is influences by top-down and bottom-up biases
	- bottom-up
		- Saliency and novelty (physically and emotionally)
		- e.g., abrupt-onset stimuli (high temporal contrast), finding object with distractors is easier if object has salient features and is able to "pop-out". Distractors with negative emotions slow search times
	- top-down
		- relfects the cognitive requirements of the task rather than the stimuli
		- If attention is directed towards one of the competing stimuli, the repressive/competative effects dissapear
		- Even if no stimuli, directed attention to a location in the visual field can increase firing rates there by 30-40% (Luck et all 1997)
		- top-down has both (additive baseline shift and multiplicative gain effects)
