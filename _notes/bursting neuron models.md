## Biophysical models

### Spatially dependent input bursts

- Larkum papers -> segregated basal and apical inputs
- Phenomenological models
	- Nauds model -> interacting DE with kernel for dendritic spikes
	- My model  -> SRM approach for analytic solutions

### Temporal dependent input bursts

- Bursts in response to temporal features of the input. Through interactions of intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., conductance's).
- Bursts as slope detectors (Kepec & Lisman)
	- Reduced Traub model with fast and slow variable in the dendrite/. 
- Chattering cells in cat superficial V1
- CA3 reduced Traub model for CA3 neurons (Pinsky and Rinzel)
