# Background

- Spiking activity is correlated within local populations
- This could either be a signature of information porcesses or impair information conveyed by firing rates 
	- Q: What about temporal coding? 
- Correlation is thought to occur becasue of shared presynaptic input
	- uncear how much this contributes. Other internal factors matter (cognitive varaibles like attention)

# Summary
- This paper explores the contribution of shared inputs to the correlation in a reccurent network



# Key Findings
- Correlations between E/I inputs decorrelate the synaptic currents to postsynaptic neurons
	- This is becasue large flucutations in E/I typically cancel each other out
