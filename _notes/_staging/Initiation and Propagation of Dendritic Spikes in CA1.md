# Background

- APs are usually generated in the soma-axon region of CA1 pyramidal neurons because it has the lowest voltage threshold
- Dendrities can sum their inputs non-linearly by producing a dendritic action potential
	- occurs when inputs are tightly localized in time and space
	- threshold is higher in the dendrites than the soma-axon
	- often lead to short-latency somatic APs for low input levels
		- i.e., neuron responds to high levels of input synchrony along the dendrite

# Methods

- Brain slices from rat CA1
- whole-cell patch clamp recordings at the soma and along the distal dendrites
- Neuron was used for simulations/modelling

# Results

- EPSC shaped currents evoked dendritic spikes
	- Amplitude of the EPSP was linear with current until the dendritic spike was ellicited (non-linea increase in amplitude)
- Threshold for dspike firing was larger than the soma
