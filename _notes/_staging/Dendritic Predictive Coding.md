# 3 Is dendritic coding biologically plausible?

Two assumption of dendritic hPC

1) cortex implemnts inference in a heirarchical probabilistic model
2) errors of the resulting predictions are computed in the local voltage dynamics of basal and apical dendrites

The first has been inventigated in the context of classical hPC, with some experiemtnal support. Which is ????

The second we will explore here. 

## 3.1 Dendritic error computation and synaptic plasticity in pyramidal neurons

- Tight E/I balance is required to compute errors in the basal dendrites
	- Inhibition and excitation are highly correlated with inhibition following a few milliseconds after
	- Serves to decorrelate spiking and leads to an efficent neural code
- Transmission delays lead to oscillations at the population level
	- Gamma oscillations in L2/3 are thought to be signatures of efficient coding in a balanced network
- Individual dendrities and even branches have also shown to be balanced
- Under assumption that membrane potentials reflect error signal
	- dendritic hPC predicts that it should influence syanptic plasticity locally through volteage-dependent rules
	- These are mediated through local calcium concentrations
	- inhibition then modualtes plasticity in a very localized manner
	- experiemntally has been shown to cover less than 15 um along the dendrite

- VDP should be different in apical vs. basal dendrites
	- basal dendrites = learning representations
	- apical dendrites = learning to enable predictions of somatic spiking
- basal rule has predicted that strong local inhibiton should promote STD in excitatory synapses
