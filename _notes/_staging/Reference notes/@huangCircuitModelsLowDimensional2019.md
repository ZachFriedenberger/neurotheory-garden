# Background

- Networks with strong EI balance are thought to produce high single-neuron varaibility through internal mechanisms (Look at citations)
	- But these models assume asynchronous activity, so they can not capture shared variability between neurons
- Models of shared variability assume a global fluctuation from an external source
	- They do not answer what the mechanisms are behind the assumed external variability
- Attention decreasing within area correlated varability (V4), but increases correlation between areas (V1 and MT)


# Summary

- Shared variability in V4 is low dimensional (1D subspace explains most of the variance)
