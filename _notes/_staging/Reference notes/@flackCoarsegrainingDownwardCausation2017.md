- [Downward causation] is the idea that higher levels of organization influence the behaviour of lower levels
- "adaptive systems tend to be intrinscially hetergoenous, noisy, and collective"

- Apparent downard causation (weak / partial, only some of the individual compnents are tuning themselves to the aggregate properties) becomes effective downward causation when
	- aggragtate properties become predictive of the future state of the system
	- aggregrate properties are robust to perturbations
	- varaibles are used universially by all components
	- components largely agree 
	- increase in mutual information bewteen the microscopic and macroscopic properties

- High agreement / high homegeneity can make the system sensitive to perturbation and move it tiwards a critical point (bad for robustness)


## Coarse-graining

- lossy but true: lose some information about the micrscopic interactions, but the representation is still true in some limit 
- let *endogenous coarse graining* be coarse graining performed by Nature 

- coarse graining allows indiviudals to make predictions without requiring they identidy and store all interactions (memory minimization)
- coarse graining allows for individuals to identify slowly varying variables that may not be noticable from micro interactions (uncertainity reduction)
	- even though coarse graining is lossy, functional information is gained becasue the signal to noise ratio is higher -> uncertainity in what constitiutes a good strategy decreases
			- maybe related to effective information? by Eric Hoel
- coarse grained varaibles need to be sufficient description of the higer-level dynamics
	- maybe related to sufficient statistics?

How does the capacity for collective coarse-graining influence the quality of effective theories that adapative systems build to make predicitions?
