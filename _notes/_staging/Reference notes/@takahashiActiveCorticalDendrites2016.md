# Background

- Dendritic Ca2+ activity in L5 cortical pyramidal neurons elevated durign cortical processing
- Apical dendrites amplify the effects of feedback inputs (apical amplification) to superficial cortical layers
- Apical amplification hypothesis predicts that Ca2+ activity in a subset of neurons correlates with the perceptual threhsold 


# Experimental setup

- Ca2+ imaging in L5 dendrites - S1/barrel cortex 
- Whisker deflection task

# Key findings

- Ca2+ activity in the apical dendrites increased with the deflection angle/stimulation of the whisker, correlating with perceptual peroformance
- Response latency was faster for larger intensity stimuli
