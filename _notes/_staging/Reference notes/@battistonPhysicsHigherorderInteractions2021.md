# Background
- Traditional graphs are limited to representing systems by pairwise interactions
- In complex systems higher-order interactions must be taken into account as they can potentially contribute to emerging macrostates
- Challening to transform datasets into [[hypergraphs]] and [[simplical complexes]]

# Summary
- Higherorder interactions lead to explosive transitions in network phehomena (e.g., synchronization)
	- more discrete phase trasnitions instead of continous ones
	- formal proof on the conditions for explosive collective behaviour is still needed
- Higher-order dynamical processes are better captured by [[hypergraphs]] and [[simplical complexes]], where edges are also dynamic, instead of just the nodes
- Inferring higher-order interactions from data is hard and better methods are needed
	- e.g., future work could use information theoretic techniques such as [[granger causaility]] or [[transfer entropy]]
- Modelling higher-order interactions is important for constructing coarse grained theories
	- See work by Bick, on chaos and chimeras 


# Take-home Message
- Higher-order interactions in complex systems needs to be fully formalised to help explain collective behaviour/computations and better methods for inferring them data are needed 


# Favorite Figure
- Good summary of how higher-order interactions lead to sharp phase transitions
