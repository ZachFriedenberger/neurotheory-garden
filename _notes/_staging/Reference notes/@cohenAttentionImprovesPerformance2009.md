# Background

- Attention is thought to increase firing rates of single-neurons and imporve signal to noise ratio
- Recent study found attention can cause a small reduction in the Fano Factor (V4 recordings)

# Summary

- Microelectroe array recordings in rhesus monkey V4 (both hemispheres) during a orientation change-detection task to probe spatial attention
	- More like both spatial and feature based because gabor stimuli were different in both locations
	- Two gabor stimuli with optimized location, size, orientation, and spatial frequency tuned to the receptice field of one neuron in each hemisphere
	- Monkey reports change in orientiation, cue to which stimulus is more likely to change
	- Detection accuracy was higher for attended stimulus
- Firing rates increased 100-300 ms after stimulus with attention
- Fano-factor decreased 100-300 ms after stimulus with attention
- Pair-wise noise correlations decreased with attention
	- this occured for all values of signal correlation (i.e., FF stimulus drive)
- The three changes were strongest for the neurons that were the most responsive to the stimuli
- 



# Take-home message

- They found that attention adaptively decreased correlated variability in a population of neurons in V4 in a change-detection task
- This decrease accounted for a large amount of the attetnional improvement and the amount of information encoded by the representations
- Shows that we need to consider population responses to understand how attention is implemented
- Decreasing shared varaibility can help population sensitivity (depends on readout) by reducing noise that can not be simply averaged out (independent noise can be averaged out easiliy during readout)
- Increases in shared varaibility can also help if readout is subtractive (Abbot & Dyan 1999, Averbeck & Pouget 2006)
