# Background

- In primary visual cortex and auditory cortex, bursts exhbiti sharper tuning curves to stimulus features than isolated spikes
- Burst firing has been proposed to encode important sensory information, this implies that burst rate should increase with attention
- V4 is thought to be implicated in attention because of lesion studies

# Key findings

- Separated cells into narrow-spiking (fast interneurons) and broad-spiking (pyramidal neurons)
- Call pyramidal neurons putative because the separation method is not perfect, 10-15% of pyramidal cell spikes will be narrow and vice-a-versa
- Attention reduced burstiness in V4 putative pyramidal neurons despite an increase in firing rate (less spikes with ISIs<4 ms)
	- Auto-correlation function also decreasesin this time range
	- This reduction tended to occur in neurons with lower firing rates
- Change in narrow spiking cells was not significant
	- but these neurons also had larger firing rates
- Modulations were primarily in low firing rate neurons
- Changes all occured when accounting for slow modulation in V4 neurons
- Hodgkin-Huxley model with muscarinic potassium and persistent sodium channels (CA1 pyramidal neuron model of bursting)
	- [[normalization model of attention]] 
		- equal increase in excitatory and inhbitiotry input to an area
	- depolarization -> activated muscarine-sensitive potassium channel-> reduces burstiness
- They claim that the reduction is purely due to subthrehsold depolarization and does not require a spiking-dependent mechanism
- Model also predicted attentional moduation of action potential height

# Take-home message

- Attention reduces burstiness and AP height of low firing-rate neurons in V4 excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons
- Can be accounted for by the interaction of synaptic conductnaces and a normalization model of attention (scaling E/I equally)



# Favorite figures

Fraction of ISIs<4 ms decreased. More potent for low firing rate neurons.

Modulations in the bursting index were most potent at low firing rates, as would be expected if dendritic spikes were modualting the burst-rate/CV
