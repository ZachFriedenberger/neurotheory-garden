## Paper idea: 

1. Logarithmic scaling theory paper 
	- Logarithmic aging via instability cascades in disordered systems (new paper in nature physics)
	- Microscopic Origin of the Logarithmic Time Evolution of Aging Processes in Complex Systems
	- Something like the paper above, but incorporating avalanche behavior into the model
	- Can anything be derived analytically?
2. Paper idea
	- Chimeras as a model of spatial up and down states - Engel paper

# Goal: Complete something to submit to Cosyne (Nov/Arxiv)

Choose one of these options: 

- [x] Allen institute - data analysis (just looking at bursting behavior)
	- Nothing really there... Need to look at population structure
- [ ] Correlated variability / noise correlations with active dendrites

# Goals: Winter Term 2024

Research 

1. Neuropixel data analysis paper
	- Is perception/learning correlated with ISI dispersion?
	- What is expected from a poisson vs. LIF vs. overdispersed model?
2. What are the statistical signatures of different learning rules? (Neurips submission in May?)
3. 

Learning

1. Read/understand deeply "Stochastic Thermodynamics"
	- Connection of fluctuation relations to different learning rules?
2. Biophysics course






# Project ideas

- Attention / Perception model - how does attentional modulation have to be to increase perception if perception relies on coding along communication subspaces or orthogonally to noise direction
- Shallow brain hypothesis / thalamocortical loops in backprop
	- How does the computational capacity compare to a strict cortico-cortico network
- Look at CV across the entire brain
- Burst prop transformers
- Models of attention in the brain...
- What are the best features to look for in neural data
