# Collective intelligence as collective computation

- Inventing temperature - Hasok Chang (recommened )
- Are macroscopic variables fundamental - can they be derived from the microscopic?
- Energy dominated variables scale sublinearly
- Information dominated macro variables scale superlinearly

Q: Why is this the case??
	- Information processes requires ...
	- 

- Harder to derive macro variables from micro in information dominated systems. i.e., where info processing is occurring
- Collectives coarse grain micro variables in an error prone way 
	- somehow find regularities 


Coarse graining
	- irrelevent details are removed
	- only important regularites remain
