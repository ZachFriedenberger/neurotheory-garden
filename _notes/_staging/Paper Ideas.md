- downward causation mechanisms in neural assembly formation
	- an additionally element of formation that is different from symmetry breaking, competetion, etc
		- Maybe something involving burst dependent plasticity? 
		- LFP/neural osillations -> bursting -> weight updates
			- What would this mean for the assembly? 

- Maybe neurons use LFP to self supervise in some way?
	- Read "Neurons learn by predicting future activity"

- Loss of conciousness as a phase transition
	- Connect statistical mech results for psychometric curves with the manipulation experiments from Takahashi/Larkums work
	- Assume burstiness/cv coding ability is essential to conciousness (Larkums work on aneastiesia)
	- Show how rate coding curves match psychometric changes as dendritic input changes
		- How does this change the cv of the output?
		- How does a change in rate/cv effect the information encoding range? For a rate or temporal code
