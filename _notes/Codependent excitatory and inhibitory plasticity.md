# Article Overview

## Background
- Experiemental work has shown that synaptic plasticity depends on the activity of nearby synapses (citations..)
- Previous theoretical work on synaptic plasticity has mainly focused on spike timing rules (2 factors) with additional neuromodulatory signals (3 factors) (citations of theoretical work)

## Summary
- This paper introduces two "4 variable" plasticity rules that takes into account local excitatory and inhibitory currents. One for excitatory synapses and one for inhibitory synapses.
- They demonstrate that their model is able to fit experimental data well and they can "explain" the long term stability of receptive fields and dendritic clustering of co-active synapses.

## Key findings
- Figure 1: Their model fits data showing how plasticity is dependent on depolarization levels and the presynaptic firing rate frequency. 
- Figure 2...
- Figure 3... 
- Figure 4... 
- Figure 5... 
- Figure 6...
- Figure 7... 
- Figure 8 ...

## Take-home message
- This papers combines multiple previously proposed rules into a single framework that captures a range of experimental observations 
- Codependent plasticity is import for understanding learning and memory because of the large amount of control E/I balance has over plasticity 




# Personal Opinions
## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths
- Highlights the importance of codependent plasticity vs. other spike based rules
	- i.e., you won't get the same dynamics from simply coming E/I spike based rules. Taking the local E/I currents into account is truly important

### Weaknesses
- Writing was rather boring
	- Took me awhile to see the broader importance of the work (basically until reading the end of the paper)
	- Authors can do a better job at "selling" the paper in the introduction
		- i.e., Why should the reader care about codependent plasticity?
	- Writing felt to encyclopedic
		- We did this thing, then we did that thing, etc
		- Authors should do a better job motivating each figure
		- I often felt myself wondering "why am I looking at this figure?", "what are they trying to say?", "what is the point?".
- Weird to me how they use the word "mesoscopic plasticity"
	- What does this even mean? 
	- Isn't it just synaptic plasticity?
	- To me mesoscopic refers to single populations of neurons or like a single cortical column
- Hard for me to unsee the local vs. nonlocal thing after Richard pointed it out
	- I think they mean non-local as refering to not that sysnapse, but neighbouring sysnapses
		- so it could still be considered local by a physics definition
- I thought the somatic dendritic coupling term was kind of weird
	- passive integration should be given by the cable equation right?? This is just an exponential scaled by the electronic length scale
	- Not sure I fully understand what they did and why they chose to do it that way
