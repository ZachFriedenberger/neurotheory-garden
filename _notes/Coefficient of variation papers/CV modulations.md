# Neural mechanisms for modulating CV 

## 1. EI balance
	- Softky and Koch
	- 

## 2. Neuromodulators
	 - Neurepinephrin known to increase random voltage fluctuations
	 - Any others?

## 3. Active dendrites
	- mentioned in Mathew Larkums L5 gain paper
	- Any others?


## 4. Synaptic varaibility
	- non-one release probability
	- funtion of STP or unreliable synapses are good for information transmission 
	- Harris, Jolivet, Attwell review

## 5. Maybe glia or some other additional source?

# Function for modulations in CV

## 1. Multiplexing
	- Richards papers
	- 

## 2.  STP/Unreliable synapses

## 3. Water filling theorem (frequency)
	- Simon Laughlin on fly retina
	- Bialek papers

## 4. Probabilistic inference

## 5. Decreasing CV to promote synchrony/produce oscillations
