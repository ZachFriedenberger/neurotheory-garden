# Background

- Electrophysiology has shown that spike count correlations change with attention and affect preceptual performance
- Theoretical work suggested that correlated varaibility may not affect the information encoded by the neural population in a manner that can influence the decision process (Moreno-Bote R et al. 2014)
	- only correlated variability along dimensions of neural population space that encode task-relevant information has an effect

# Summary

- Authors measure the relationship between population acitivty and performance by studying two different timescales, attention and perceptual learning
- Same experiement as used in [[@cohenAttentionImprovesPerformance2009 |Cohen et al. 2009]], but attention was measured during each session and learning was measured across sessions
- Each process was associated with a decrease in Fano factor of individual units and the correlated variability between pairs of units
	- this occured only under the task condition, not under passive viewing
- Correlated varaibility in V1 was not correlated with performance

# Take-home message

- Perceptual learning also decreases fano-factor and noise correlations, but on a slower timescale than attention
- Attention and perceptual learning may rely on similar computations, but on different timescales

# Open questions

- Does attention help guide learning in some way? 
	- In their experiments, attended/unattended trials were in random blocks with an 80/20 split, so it would be hard to distinguish attentions effects on perceptual learning
