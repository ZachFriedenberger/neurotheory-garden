# Background

- Previous experiemental/theoretical work suggests that the brain operates as a predictive system
- Learning rules are not generally derived from first principles
- Contrastive hebbian learning has two phases (free and clamped) making it biologically implausible

# Summary 

- Authors derive a learning rule where each neuron predicts its own future activity (minimizing surprise)
- They use metabolic constraints
