# Background

- Feedback from H.O. areas and thalamocortical pathways carry information to L5 distal dendrites in L1
	- Mainly excitatory input
	- Throught to underlie attention and binding
- Dendritic spikes lead to bursting in the soma
- Unknown how BAPs and dendritic spikes interact when inputs are noisey and have fluctuations

# Summary
- This paper investigates the input-output function of L5 pyramidal neurons with noisey current injected into the distal dendrites and the soma
- Dendritic Ca2+ conductances are responsible for an increase in gain and coefficient of variation
- Timing of bursts only occurs if inputs are coincident in a narrow window of time
- They present a minimal model that captures these effects

# Key Findings

- Gain and threshold for i/o function increase with the distance of the input location from the soma
- Distal dendritic input increases CV higher than somatic input
- Small somatic input increases the effectiveness of dendritic input
- Bursts are correlated with coincident input to the dendrites and soma, while single spikes are correlated with somatic input only
