# Background

- Attention appears to scale tuning curves multiplicatively and not selectivly (Vogels and Orban 1991, Motter 1993, McAdams and Maunsell 1999)
- Effect of attention on neural variability had not been studied at this time
- For a poisson process $SNR = \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda}} = \sqrt{\lambda}$, increases with the mean response of the neuron

# Summary

- [[Delayed match-to-sample task]]
	- Monkey fixates on a point and then depresses a lever to start the trial
	- After two correct instruction trials (only 1 stimuli shown), the distractor was introduced again and attention was directed at the same stimulus for the rest of the trials
	- Attended trials = neural recordings with a receptive fild overlapping with the stimulus
	- Unattended trials = recordings when the receptive field did not overlap with the relevent stimulus

- Response variability
	- After fitting a power function to the spike variance vs. spike count only a small percent had significant modulation from attention (either up or down)
		- 5% of cells had a significant power coefficient 
		- 12% of cells had a significant scale 

	- Tuning curves show an increase in 30% for all Gabor orientations

- Response discriminability
	- Signal to noise ratio increases with the response magnitude

- Temporal coding
	- Burst rate increased significantly with attention for some of the bursting definitions, but all neurons followed the same power function 
	- They used ISI cutoffs of 2 , 5, 8, 10 ms for doublets and triplet bursts


# Take-home message

- Increased neural responsiveness associated with attention does not alter response varability (burstiness) from what is expected from the burst vs. firing rate function in the unattened state
- Increased neural reponsiveness improved stimulus discriminability in the atteneded state
