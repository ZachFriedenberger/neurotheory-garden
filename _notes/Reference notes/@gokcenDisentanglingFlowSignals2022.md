# Background

- More and more recordings of populations from different brain areas are made available (neuropixel probes)
- Previous work looking at the direction of information flow used either signal delays, spike-time correations between areas, or dimensionality reduction techniques

# Summary

- How to disentangle concurrent, bidirectional flow of signals between populations of neurons? 
- Authors introduce a dimensionality reuction technique called delayed-latents aross groups (DLAG) to answer this question
- They demonstrate that it works on synthetic data and they apply it to V1-V2 recordings from primate visual cortex

# Key findings

- Able to recover latent varaibles and estimate the dimesnion of the subspaces on synthetic data (generated by their model to define the input for linear-non-linear possion neurons)
- Model is a Gaussian process with terms for within and between area communication. Between area communication channels have a fixed delay, which allows for the direction of signal flow to be determined
	- 
- They apply model to data from V1/V2 in primate visual cortex
	- visual grating stimulus appears to be feedforward from V1 (superficial/output layers) to V2 (middel/input layers)
	- feedback signal from V2 to V1 comes a bit after
		- most likely not direct feedback because of the layers they are recording in
- More V2->V1 feedback latents than V1->V2 latents (highly asymmetric)
- Gaussian process timescales increases up the cortical heirachy
