#MST #attention #bursting 

# Background

- V4 neurons (ventral stream) decrease burstiness with spatial attention [[@andersonAttentiondependentReductionsBurstiness2013]]
- Unknow if this occurs in other visual areas - medial superior temporal area (MST, dorsal stream)
	- key motion processing area
- Unknown if the reduction in burstiness also occurs for feature based attention 


# Key findings

- They could not separte neuron cell type based on waveform durations like the paper by [[@andersonAttentiondependentReductionsBurstiness2013]]
	- no bimodality 
- Increase in firing rate for spatial and frature based attention
	- only a decrease in burstiness for spatial attention


# Take-home message

- Increase in firing rate for spatial and frature based attention
	- only a decrease in burstiness for spatial attention
	- this implies that they rely on different mechanisms or that the change in burstiness invovles a secondary pathway that moduatles bursting
