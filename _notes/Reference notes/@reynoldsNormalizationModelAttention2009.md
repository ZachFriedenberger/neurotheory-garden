# Introduction

- Correlates of visual attention at the single neuron level
	- fixed multiplicative gain factor (McAdams Maunsell 1999)
	- change in contrast gain (Li and Basso 2008 and others)
	- intermediate changes between response gain and constrast gain 
	- sharpening if tuning at single neuron and population (Martinex-Trujilo 2004, Spitzer 1988)
	- Reduction in firing rate when attention is directed towards nonpreferred stimulus paired with the preferred stimulus inside the receptive field (Reynolds and Desimone 2003)

- Model incorporates these phenomena of attentional modulation with divisive normalization (Heeger 1992b)
- Reconcile model with other theories
	- Moran and Desimone 1985- Receptive field shrinking with attention
	- Desimone and Duncan 1995 - Biased competition model 
	- McAdams and Maunsell 1999 - Fixed gain factor
	- True and Martiniez-Trujilo 1999 - feature-similarit gain principle. gain depends on the amtch between a meurons stimulus selectivity and the features or locations being attended
	- Spitzer 1988 - neural tuning sharpening. True and Martinez-Trujilo say this is predicted by feature-similarity gain principle
	- Reynolds 2000 - increase contrast gain (Look at the cited papers)
