> **tl;dr:** identifies an ordered set of orthogonal directions that captures the greatest variance in the data.

- Obscures spiking variability (output noise) with firing rate variability (temporal changes in time). 
- Typically applied to smoothed or averaged neural data in which the spiking variability has been minimized
- For raw spike counts, use [[FA ðŸš§|Factor Analysis]], as this can decompose changes in FR from spiking variability. I.e., separate independent noise for each neuron. FA is PCA but with an explicit noise model.
