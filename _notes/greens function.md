# Motivation
- We want a general technique to solve inhomogenous ordinary differential equations (i.e., dynamics with dynamic inputs)
- Basic idea is to find how the system responds to a pulse input (dirac delta function) and then propagate the dynamic inputs according to the dynamics

# Definition

# How to find the Green's fucntion


# Constructing new Green's functions from old ones
